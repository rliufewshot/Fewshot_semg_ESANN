# Fewshot_semg_ESANN
Here is the code for ESANN paper Few-shot similarity learning for motion classification via electromyography.

In FewshotSiameseTesting, transfer learning, Contrastive loss, Siamese network with 4 distance functions are tested, and the test results are recorded.

In CNN1d.py, the 1d convoluational neural network model is provided.

In siamese_L4.py, the model of Siamese network with 4 different distance functions are provided.

siamese_contrastive.py offers the model of Siamese network with contrastive loss.

In setup.py, the data preprocessing for Ninapro dataset is in it.

In contrastive loss.py offers a typical contrastive loss function.
